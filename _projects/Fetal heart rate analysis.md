Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) monitoring is routinely used to help obstetricians assess fetal health status during delivery. In daily clinical practice, FHR is mostly examined visually following the guidelines edited by national and international scientific societies, such as the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO), that mostly focus on decelerations and accelerations, long term variabilities, and baseline levels and trends.


Instead of performing the analysis of variability at pre-defined time
scales proposed in the FIGO clinical guidelines, the originality of this project is to embrace the scale invariance paradigm which measures the relationship between the data variability across several scales.
