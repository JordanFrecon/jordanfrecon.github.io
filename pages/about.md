# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

I am currently an associate professor in machine learning. I teach at Télécom Saint-Etienne (Jean  Monnet University, Université de Lyon) while I conduct my research within the Hubert Curien Laboratory in the Data Intelligence team.
Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the LITIS group (INSA Rouen Normandie) working with <a href="http://asi.insa-rouen.fr/enseignants/~scanu/" target="_blank">Stéphane Canu</a>. In 2021, I benefited from an external collaborator position at the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT) in the Computational Statistics and Machine Learning group directed by <a href="https://www.iit.it/it/people/massimiliano-pontil" target="_blank">Massimiliano Pontil</a> where I used to work as a postdoctoral researcher from 2017 to 2020. I defended my PhD in Physics at the Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon (ENS de Lyon) on October 11th 2016, under the supervision of <a href="http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/patrice.abry/" target="_blank">Patrice Abry</a> and <a href="http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/nelly.pustelnik/" target="_blank">Nelly Pustelnik</a>.
