<h1>MATh.en.JEANS</h1>
The organization <a href="https://www.mathenjeans.fr/" target="_blank">MATh.en.JEANS</a> aims to bring mathematics to life for young people, according to the principles of mathematical research. It allows young students to meet researchers and practice an authentic scientific approach in schools, from its theoretical to applied dimensions and if possible in touch with current research themes. Since 2020, I have been invited to collaborate and animate workshops with the <a href="https://www.europeanschoolthehague.nl/" target="_blank">European School The Hague</a> and the <a href="https://lfvvg.com/" target="_blank">French Lycée Vincent-Van-Gogh</a>. 

For the 2020-2021 edition, I have proposed subjects about card tricks and autonomous vehicles. Throughout the year, students have acquired knowledge ranging from numeral systems and object-oriented programming to deep Q-learning.

During 2021-2022, I have suggested research projects on face recognition, robust coding systems and fairness in machine learning.


<h1>Teaching Experience</h1>

Since September 2022, I am a associate professor in Machine learning at <a href="https://www.telecom-st-etienne.fr/" target="_blank">Telecom Saint-Etienne (TSE)</a> where I give courses both in the Engineer program (FISE) and the Data Engineering Apprenticeship program (FISA). I am also involved in the international master program <a href="https://mldm.univ-st-etienne.fr/" target="_blank">Machine Learning and Data Mining (MLDM)</a> of the <a href="https://www.univ-st-etienne.fr/en/index.html" target="_blank">Universite Jean Monnet (UJM)</a><br>

In 2021-2022, I have done teaching vacations at <a href="https://www.insa-rouen.fr/" target="_blank">INSA Rouen Normandie</a>. From 2013 to 2016, I benefited from a teaching activity grant. I gave tutorial classes as well as oral exercices and supervised practical exercices at <a href="https://www.univ-lyon1.fr/" target="_blank">Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1</a> and <a href="http://www.ens-lyon.fr/" target="_blank">Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon</a>.<br><br>
