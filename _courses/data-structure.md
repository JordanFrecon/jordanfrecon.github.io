> This course is inspired and partly based on the one written by [Christophe Gravier](https://cgravier.fr/). It will evolve over the next few years according to feedback from students and teachers.

This course provides a comprehensive understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms while emphasizing proficiency in C/C++ implementation.

## <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Prerequisites

It is advised to have a foundational understanding of mathematical concepts such as sets, functions, and elementary algorithms. Prior experience in programming is recommended.

## <i class="fas fa-bookmark"></i> Educational Goals

By the end of the course, participants should be adept at structuring programs using various data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, binary search trees, and bloom filters. Furthermore, the course aims to cultivate problem-solving skills by demonstrating how to choose and implement appropriate data structures and algorithms for different scenarios. Through practical examples and exercises, participants will not only enhance their coding skills but also develop the ability to analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms, enabling them to make informed decisions in real-world programming scenarios.
