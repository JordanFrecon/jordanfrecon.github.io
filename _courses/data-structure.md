> This course is inspired and partly based on the one written by [Christophe Gravier](https://cgravier.fr/). It will evolve over the next few years according to feedback from students and teachers.

This course provides a comprehensive understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms while emphasizing proficiency in C/C++ implementation.

## <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Prerequisites

Participants are expected to have a proficient understanding of the following prerequisites:

- Fundamental problem-solving skills.
- Familiarity with algorithmic (loops, conditional statements, etc.).
- Basic mathematical concepts such as sets, functions, and elementary algorithms.
- Prior experience in computing (Python or C/C++), ensuring a comfortable entry into the complexities of data structures and algorithms.

## <i class="fas fa-bookmark"></i> Educational Goals

This course delineates specific educational goals aimed at enhancing algorithmic and data structure skills:

- Master the art of structuring programs using static arrays, dynamic allocation, character arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, binary search trees, and bloom filters.
- Develop advanced problem-solving skills by selecting and implementing appropriate data structures and algorithms for diverse scenarios.
- Analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms, facilitating informed decision-making in real-world programming challenges.
- Hone coding proficiency through practical examples and exercises.
- Cultivate a deep understanding of the principles behind data structures and algorithms, ensuring participants can confidently tackle intricate computational problems.
