This course offers a solid foundation in Python programming while introducing essential concepts and practices of data science. Students will progressively learn how to manipulate, analyze, and represent data using modern Python tools.

## <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Prerequisites

Participants are expected to have a proficient understanding of the following prerequisites:

- Probability.
- Statistics (descriptive and inferential).
- Mathematical foundations (analysis, linear algebra, etc.).

## <i class="fas fa-bookmark"></i> Educational Goals

The course is designed to provide both programming practice and methodological grounding in data science:

- Acquire strong fundamentals in Python programming and gain an introduction to data science.
- Discover and apply key Python libraries for data analysis (NumPy, pandas, etc.).
- Evaluate data quality and manage missing values, outliers, and class imbalance.
- Apply appropriate feature transformations and selection techniques.
- Employ methods to effectively represent, explore, and interpret data.
