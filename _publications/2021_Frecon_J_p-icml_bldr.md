We present a framework based on bilevel optimization for learning multilayer, deep data representations. While the lower-level problem implicitly defines the representation through the critical point of a learnable objective, the upper-level problem optimizes the representation mapping. We reformulate the problem via a majorization minimization algorithm. On one hand, for some quadratic majorants, we show that the bilevel problem reduces down to the training of a feedforward neural network. On the other hand, for majorants based on Bregman distances, we introduce a new neural network architecture involving the inverse of the activation function. We argue theoretically that the novel architecture may have better mathematical properties than standard networks. Numerical experiments show that the proposed variant benefits from better training behaviors, resulting in more accurate prediction.
