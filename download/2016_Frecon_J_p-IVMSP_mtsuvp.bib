  abstract={The present contribution aims at segmenting a scale-free texture into different regions, characterized by an a priori (unknown) multifractal spectrum. The multifractal properties are quantified using multiscale quantities C1, j and C2, j that quantify the evolution along the analysis scales 2j of the empirical mean and variance of a nonlinear transform of wavelet coefficients. The segmentation is performed jointly across all the scales j on the concatenation of both C1, j and C2, j by an efficient vectorial extension of a convex relaxation of the piecewise constant Potts segmentation problem. We provide comparisons with the scalar segmentation of the HÃ¶lder exponent as well as independent vectorial segmentations over C1 and C2.},
